# Uncovering the Hidden Profiles in Wine Data


![portada](assets/wine_portada_img.png)

This project is focused on examining wines by conducting a detailed analysis of their features.

The dataset consists of the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region of Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The analysis determined the quantities of 13 components present in each of the three types of wines.

Patterns in the data will be sought to reveal valuable information and gain a deeper understanding of how their properties are related. The wine categories that can be used for classification will also be identified through the development of a clustering model.
